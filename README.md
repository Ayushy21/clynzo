# 🩺 Clynzo – The Doctor Appointment App That Saves Patients... and Developers’ Grades

Built with 💻 + ☕ + 😭 by a team of curious devs who decided that sleep is optional but deploying a full-stack app is mandatory.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

**Clynzo** is not just an appointment booking app — it’s our *caffeine-powered* masterpiece! Built using the **MERN Stack**, this full-stack platform allows:

- 🧑‍⚕️ Doctors to manage schedules, patients, and earnings  
- 🧍‍♂️ Patients to book appointments and pay online  
- 🧙 Admins to control everything like Gandalf

Whether you're building your portfolio, finishing a college project, or just trying to impress your crush with a deployed link — **Clynzo's got your back!**
